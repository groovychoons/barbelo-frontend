    <th>By focusing on the story behind a project, we provide angels with an insight into every detail. The reason this
approach is so fundamentally important is that it allows people to connect. We live in an age where the physical
boundaries that once separated us no longer apply, however, our natural inquisition to get to know a person will
never change. When you know someone, you build a relationship, and thus you are more inclined to provide your 
assistance in any way that you can.</th>
